# my first hack & mod

playing `nibbles` in the back corner of the computer lab was the first time i *"hacked"* something to make it do something else. it was also the first time i *"modded"* a game, (...changing variables in the BATCH script)

fastForward a few decades, and i decided to give myself a weekEnd challenge, can i remake it online... well yes, because here it is. i guess i have to add levels next
